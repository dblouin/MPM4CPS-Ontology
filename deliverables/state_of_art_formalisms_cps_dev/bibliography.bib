	abstract = {The recent proliferation of embedded cyber components in modern physical systems [1] has generated a variety of new security risks which threaten not only cyberspace, but our physical environment as well. Whereas earlier security threats resided primarily in cyberspace, the increasing marriage of digital technology with mechanical systems in cyber-physical systems (CPS), suggests the need for more advanced generalized CPS security measures. To address this problem, in this paper we consider the first step toward an improved security model: detecting the security attack. Using logical truth tables, we have developed a generalized algorithm for intrusion detection in CPS for systems which can be defined over discrete set of valued states. Additionally, a robustness algorithm is given which determines the level of security of a discrete-valued CPS against varying combinations of multiple signal alterations. These algorithms, when coupled with encryption keys which disallow multiple signal alteration, provide for a generalized security methodology for both cyber-security and cyber-physical systems.},

The definition provides a machine and system independent view of the language as it is seen by the Java programmer. It takes care to directly reflect the description in the Java language reference manual so that the basic design decisions can be checked by standardizers and implementors against a mathematical model.",

abstract="We have shown that it is possible to automatically synthesize the synchronization skeleton of a concurrent program from a Temporal Logic specification. We believe that this approach may in the long run turn out to be quite practical. Since synchronization skeletons are, in general, quite small, the potentially exponential behavior of our algorithm need not be an insurmountable obstacle. Much additional research will be needed, however, to make the approach feasible in practice.",

Because of their versatility, stochastic hybrid systems have emerged as a powerful framework for capturing the intricacies of complex systems. Motivated by this, considerable research effort has been devoted to the development of modeling, analysis and control methods for stochastic hybrid systems. In this introductory paper to the special issue, we outline recent progress in this challenging research area and argue that synergies between methods developed by different communities in computer science, control engineering, and stochastic analysis should be exploited to allow progress in real life, large scale applications."

	abstract = "A method for approximate model checking of stochastic hybrid systems with provable approximation guarantees is proposed. We focus on the probabilistic invariance problem for discrete time stochastic hybrid systems and propose a two-step scheme. The stochastic hybrid system is first approximated by a finite state Markov chain. The approximating chain is then model checked for probabilistic invariance. Under certain regularity conditions on the transition and reset kernels governing the dynamics of the stochastic hybrid system, the invariance probability computed using the approximating Markov chain is shown to converge to the invariance probability of the original stochastic hybrid system, as the grid used in the approximation gets finer. A bound on the convergence rate is also provided. The performance of the two-step approximate model checking procedure is assessed on a case study of a multi-room heating system."

Examples of hybrid systems include medical equipment, manufacturing controllers, automotive controllers, and robots. The formal analysis of the mixed digital-analog nature of these systems requires a model that incorporates the discrete behavior of computer programs with the continuous behavior of environment variables, such as temperature and pressure. Hybrid automata capture both types of behavior by combining finite automata with differential inclusions (i.e. differential inequalities). HyTech is a symbolic model checker for linear hybrid automata, an expressive, yet automatically analyzable, subclass of hybrid automata. A key feature of HyTech is its ability to perform parametric analysis, i.e. to determine the values of design parameters for which a linear hybrid automaton satisfies a temporal requirement.",

abstract = "Although discontinuous, non-smooth or switched dynamical systems have been broadly studied, there still exist dynamical behaviours which are not completely understood. In particular, those related to transitions between state-space regions and to crossings through discontinuity surfaces. The problem of specifying system transitions becomes crucial when multiple discontinuity surfaces or switching elements are present. In this case, a great deal of care has to be taken in order to simulate the system and to verify its properties. Obtaining a computational model appears to be an elegant way for the specification of the transitions and event-triggered phenomena involved in the dynamical behaviour of discontinuous systems. This is the goal of this paper. A class of discontinuous dynamical systems including control inputs and outputs is reinterpreted within the hybrid-automata framework, and what is referred as to discontinuous-dynamical-systemhybrid automaton is proposed. An example is used, which corresponds to a 2-degrees-of-freedom electromechanical system including discontinuous friction and sliding-mode control. This system exhibits several discontinuity surfaces which give rise to different types of transitions and dynamical behaviours. New computational-kind phenomena may arise when the system is reinterpreted as a hybrid dynamical system. Nevertheless, this paper only deals with the modelling and specification of the system."

abstract = "There is a gap between the modelling and the simulation of discontinuous dynamical systems (DDS) exhibiting sliding-mode behaviour. Several challenges arise. Mainly, the definition of unique solutions on the discontinuity surfaces and at their crossings. There are also numerical issues in the detection and location of the trajectory entering and going out of the discontinuity surface, as well as when it remains on the discontinuity surface (chattering phenomenon). The aim of this paper is establishing a semantics for DDS so that a deterministic dynamical behaviour can be defined for simulation purposes. Particularly, a class of DDS is modelled by using two different hybrid automata. One of them is called the DDS hybrid automaton, proposed by the author previously. The other is obtained by modifying the DDS hybrid automaton, and is inspired in computer-simulation-oriented friction models. The use of a computational model is an elegant way for specifying the multiple transitions in DDS. The modelling framework is specially useful for specifying transitions when multiple discontinuity surfaces are present. A system with discontinuous friction and stick-slip oscillations is used to validate the models. In the example, it is concluded that discontinuous systems can be appropriately simulated by using hybrid-automaton-based models without the problem of chattering. On the other hand, the system dynamical behaviour can change depending on the step size of the numerical integration method and on the hybrid-automaton representation used. The hybrid models are simulated by means of Simulink/Stateflow package."

abstract = "Requirements for high availability in computing systems today demand that systems be self-adaptive to maintain expected qualities-of-service in the presence of system faults, variable environmental conditions, and changing user requirements. Autonomic computing tackles the challenge of automating tasks that humans would otherwise have to perform to achieve this goal. However, existing approaches to autonomic computing lack the ability to capture routine human repair tasks in a way that takes into account the business context humans use in selecting an appropriate form of adaptation, while dealing with timing delays and uncertainties in outcome of repair actions. In this article, we present Stitch, a language for representing repair strategies within the context of an architecture-based self-adaptation framework. Stitch supports the explicit representation of repair decision trees together with the ability to express business objectives, allowing a self-adaptive system to select a strategy that has optimal utility in a given context, even in the presence of potential timing delays and outcome uncertainty."

@book{Horni2016,
 abstract = {The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status.The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations.The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core.The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis.Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references.We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.},

	abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

No nonlinear device, e.g., the simplest p-n junction diode, is supported, thereby limiting the utility of this framework. In a very rudimentary way, a bi-junction transistor (BJT) or metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) may be modeled as a switch. The ELN module structure is very similar to that of LSF---SystemC-AMS [1] built-in modules connected appropriately via channels. Moreover, like LSF, ELN modules need to interact with either TDF or pure SystemC modules to read in/out data. In the ELN examples examined subsequently, SystemC-AMS library module sca{\_}eln::sca{\_}node is used as the electrical terminal for each electrical device, rather than the sca{\_}eln::sca{\_}terminal. This is because the latter has to be bound to the sca{\_}eln::sca{\_}node in the final circuit, for correct simulation.",

Because of the importance of UML-RT we are investigating its formal foundation in a joint project between ObjecTime Limited, Technische Universit{\"a}t M{\"u}nchen and the University of Bucharest. Our results clearly show that the visual notation of UML-RT is not only very intuitive but it also has a very deep mathematical foundation.

	abstract="The Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) is currently one of the most used model transformation languages and has become a de facto standard in model-driven engineering for implementing model transformations. At the same time, it is understood by the community that enhancing methods for exhaustively verifying such transformations allows for a more widespread adoption of model-driven engineering in industry. A variety of proposals for the verification of ATL transformations have arisen in the past few years. However, the majority of these techniques are either based on non-exhaustive testing or on proof methods that require human assistance and/or are not complete. In this paper, we describe our method for statically verifying the declarative subset of ATL model transformations. This verification is performed by translating the transformation (including features like filters, OCL expressions, and lazy rules) into our model transformation language DSLTrans. As we handle only the declarative portion of ATL, and DSLTrans is Turing-incomplete, this reduction in expressivity allows us to use a symbolic-execution approach to generate representations of all possible input models to the transformation. We then verify pre-/post-condition contracts on these representations, which in turn verifies the transformation itself. The technique we present in this paper is exhaustive for the subset of declarative ATL model transformations. This means that if the prover indicates a contract holds on a transformation, then the contract's pre-/post-condition pair will be true for any input model for that transformation. We demonstrate and explore the applicability of our technique by studying several relatively large and complex ATL model transformations, including a model transformation developed in collaboration with our industrial partner. As well, we present our `slicing' technique. This technique selects only those rules in the DSLTrans transformation needed for contract proof, thereby reducing proving time.",

The prover evaluated atomic contracts to yield either true or false for the transformation when run on any input model. In this paper we extend the prover such that it can verify atomic contracts and more complex properties composed of atomic contracts. Besides demonstrating our prover on a simple transformation, we use it to verify different kinds of properties of an industrial transformation. Experiments on this transformation using our prover show a speed-up in verification run-time by two orders of magnitude over another verification tool that we evaluated in previous research.",

Current workflow languages are not able to completely fulfil these requirements, as they lack expressiveness and flexibility. In this paper, we present an object-oriented workflow language for formalizing processes within heterogeneous and dynamic environments. Its component-based meta-model enables the hierarchical composition of processes and process variants. Domain-specific typing and polymorphism leverage the flexibility of processes by enabling the dynamic selection of process components. We present a modelling environment and a distributed execution engine for the meta-model. In addition, we discuss the use of semantic technologies for smart workflows."
