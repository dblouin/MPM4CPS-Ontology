title="Collaborative traceability management: a multiple case study from the perspectives of organization, process, and culture",

abstract="Traceability is crucial for many activities in software and systems engineering including monitoring the development progress, and proving compliance with standards. In practice, the use and maintenance of trace links are challenging as artifacts undergo constant change, and development takes place in distributed scenarios with multiple collaborating stakeholders. Although traceability management in general has been addressed in previous studies, there is a need for empirical insights into the collaborative aspects of traceability management and how it is situated in existing development contexts. The study reported in this paper aims to close this gap by investigating the relation of collaboration and traceability management, based on an understanding of characteristics of the development effort. In our multiple exploratory case study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 individuals from 15 industrial projects. We explored which challenges arise, how traceability management can support collaboration, how collaboration relates to traceability management approaches, and what characteristics of the development effort influence traceability management and collaboration. We found that practitioners struggle with the following challenges: (1) collaboration across team and tool boundaries, (2) conveying the benefits of traceability, and (3) traceability maintenance. If these challenges are addressed, we found that traceability can facilitate communication and knowledge management in distributed contexts. Moreover, there exist multiple approaches to traceability management with diverse collaboration approaches, i.e., requirements-centered, developer-driven, and mixed approaches. While traceability can be leveraged in software development with both agile and plan-driven paradigms, a certain level of rigor is needed to realize its benefits and overcome challenges. To support practitioners, we provide principles of collaborative traceability management. The main contribution of this paper is empirical evidence of how culture, processes, and organization impact traceability management and collaboration, and principles to support practitioners with collaborative traceability management. We show that collaboration and traceability management have the potential to be mutually beneficial---when investing in one, also the other one is positively affected.",

abstract="As it is widely recognized, a universal notation accepted by any software architect cannot exist. This caused a proliferation of architecture description languages (ADLs) each focussing on a specific application domain, analysis type, or modelling environment, and with its own specific notations and tools. Therefore, the production of a software architecture description often requires the use of multiple ADLs, each satisfying some stakeholder's concerns. When dealing with multiple notations, suitable techniques are required in order to keep models in a consistent state. Several solutions have been proposed so far but they lack in convergence and scalability. In this paper, we propose a convergent change propagation approach between multiple architectural languages. The approach is generic since it depends neither on the notations to synchronize nor on their corresponding models. It is implemented within the Eclipse modelling framework and we demonstrate its usability and scalability by experimenting it on well known architectural languages.",

abstract="The current practice of software architecture modeling and analysis would benefit of using different architectural languages, each specialized on a particular view and each enabling specific analysis. Thus, it is fundamental to pursue architectural language interoperability. An approach for enabling interoperability consists in defining a transformation from each single notation to a pivot language, and vice versa. When the pivot assumes the form of a small and abstract kernel, extension mechanisms are required to compensate the loss of information. The aim of this paper is to enhance architectural languages interoperability by means of hierarchies of pivot languages obtained by systematically extending a root pivot language. Model-driven techniques are employed to support the creation and the management of such hierarchies and to realize the interoperability by means of model transformations. Even though the approach is applied to the software architecture domain, it is completely general.",

abstract="Developing software for dynamic cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a complex task. One has to deal with the dynamicity and unreliability of the physical environment where the software resides in, while, at the same time, provide sufficient levels of dependability and scalability. Although emerging software engineering abstractions, such as dynamic ad-hoc component ensembles, provide a convenient way to structure software for dynamic CPS, they need to be mapped to robust decentralized execution schemes in real-life settings. A particular challenge in this context is the robust distributed data dissemination in dynamic networks. Gossip-based communication stands as a promising solution to this challenge. We argue, that exploitation of application-specific information, software architecture in particular, has a large potential for improving the robustness and performance of gossip-based communication. This paper proposes a synergy between high-level architectural models and low-level communication models to effectively enable application-specific gossiping in component-based systems. The synergy is exemplified on the DEECo component model which is tailored to the needs and specifics of CPS, and evaluated on an emergency coordination case study with realistic network configurations.",

abstract="Electro-mobility (e-mobility) is one of the promising technologies being considered by automotive OEMs as an alternative to internal combustion engines as a means of propulsion. The e-mobility case study provides a novel example of a relevant industry application within the ASCENS framework. An overview of the system design is given which describes how e-mobility is conceptualized and then transformed using the ensemble development life cycle (EDLC) approach into a distributed autonomic (i.e self-aware, self-adaptive) component-based software system. The system requirements engineering is based on the state-of-the-affairs (SOTA) approach and the invariant refinement method (IRM) which are both revisited and applied. Regarding the implementation and deployment of the system, a dependable emergent ensembles of components (DEECo) approach is utilized. The DEECo components and ensembles are coded and deployed using the Java-based jDEECo runtime environment. The runtime environment integrates the multi-agent transport simulation tool (MATSim), which is used to predict the effects of the physical interactions of users, vehicles and infrastructure resources. jDEECo handles multiple MATSim instances to allow for different belief states between components and ensembles.",

abstract = "Design of self-adaptive software-intensive cyber–physical systems (siCPS) operating in dynamic environments is a significant challenge when a sufficient level of dependability is required. This stems partly from the fact that the concerns of self-adaptivity and dependability are to an extent contradictory. In this paper, we introduce IRM-SA (Invariant Refinement Method for Self-Adaptation)—a design method and associated formally grounded model targeting siCPS—that addresses self-adaptivity and supports dependability by providing traceability between system requirements, distinct situations in the environment, and predefined configurations of system architecture. Additionally, IRM-SA allows for architecture self-adaptation at runtime and integrates the mechanism of predictive monitoring that deals with operational uncertainty. As a proof of concept, it was implemented in DEECo, a component framework that is based on dynamic ensembles of components. Furthermore, its feasibility was evaluated in experimental settings assuming decentralized system operation."

abstract="One of the key properties of autonomic component systems is their dynamicity and context-dependence of their behavior. In contrast to systems with a static architecture, their components interact and collaborate in an ad-hoc fashion depending on their internal state and location, the state of other components and their locations, timing and history of events/state of external (uncontrolled) environment. This high degree of dynamicity collides with traditional approaches to security, which typically rely on static hierarchies of roles and a static assignment of roles. To address this problem, we formulate security rules which are autonomically composable and context-dependent; in their evolution, they follow the dynamicity and context-dependence of the autonomic components. Based on our previous work with autonomic component ensembles, we show how ensembles can be exploited to define security rules to control interactions in a system of autonomic components.",

	abstract = {As part of the AMMA project (ATLAS Model Management Architecture), we are currently building several model management tools to support the tasks of modeling in the large and of modeling in the small. The basic idea is to define an experimental framework based on the principle of models as first class entities. This allows us to investigate issues of conceptual and practical interest in the field of model management applied to data-intensive applications. By modeling in the small, we mean dealing with model and metamodel elements and the relations between them. In this sense, ATL (ATLAS Transformation Language) allows expressing automatic model transformations. We also motivate the need for the �ModelWeaver� which handles fine-grained relationships between elements of different metamodels with a different purpose than automatic model transformation. By modeling in the large, we mean globally dealing with models, metamodels and their properties and relations. We use the notion of a �MegaModel� to describe a registry for models and metamodels. This paper proposes a lightweight architectural style for a model-engineering platform as well as a first prototype implementation demonstrating its feasibility.}

      ABSTRACT = {Software engineering is not only about technical solutions. It is to a large extent also concerned with organizational issues, project management and human behaviour. For a discipline like software engineering, empirical methods are crucial, since they allow for incorporating human behaviour into the research approach taken. Empirical methods are common practice in many other disciplines. This chapter provides a motivation for the use of empirical methods in software engineering research. The main motivation is that it is needed from an engineering perspective to allow for informed and well-grounded decision. The chapter continues with a brief introduction to four research methods: controlled experiments, case studies, surveys and post-mortem analyses. These methods are then put into an improvement context. The four methods are presented with the objective to introduce the reader to the methods to a level that it is possible to select the most suitable method at a specific instance. The methods have in common that they all are concerned with quantitative data. However, several of them are also suitable for qualitative data. Finally, it is concluded that the methods are not competing. On the contrary, the different research methods can preferably be used together to obtain more sources of information that hopefully lead to more informed engineering decisions in software engineering.},

      ABSTRACT = {Abstract As model management platforms are gaining industrial attention, the importance of automated model querying techniques is also increasing. Several important engineering tasks supported by model-based tools such as well-formedness constraint validation or model transformations rely on efficiently evaluating model queries. If the models change rapidly or frequently, it is beneficial to provide live and incrementally evaluated queries that automatically propagate model changes to keep query results consistent. The current paper reports on the of EMF-IncQuery framework focusing on new features of its integrated development environment (such as query validation and visualization) and its support for integrating queries to existing applications (e.g. by auto-generated data bindings) built on top of the industry standard Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Our approach is illustrated on a case study integrating well-formedness constraints to the Papyrus UML tool by live model queries of EMF-IncQuery with negligible additional manual programming effort.},

      ABSTRACT = {Inconsistencies in design models should be detected immediately to save the engineer from unnecessary rework. Yet, tools are not capable of keeping up with the engineers' rate of model changes. This paper presents an approach for quickly, correctly, and automatically deciding what consistency rules to evaluate when a model changes. The approach does not require consistency rules with special annotations. Instead, it treats consistency rules as black-box entities and observes their behavior during their evaluation to identify what model elements they access. The UML/Analyzer tool, integrated with IBM Rational Rose, fully implements this approach. It was used to evaluate 29 models with tens-of-thousands of model elements, evaluated on 24 types of consistency rules over 140,000 times. We found that the approach provided design feedback correctly and required, in average, less than 9ms evaluation time per model change with a worst case of less than 2 seconds at the expense of a linearly increasing memory need. This is a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.}

To perform this computation efficiently, several incremental methods have been developed. The main goal of these methods is to consider as few of the entities in an information base as possible, which is generally achieved by reasoning from the structural events that define the effect of the operations. In this paper, we propose a new method for dealing with the incremental evaluation of the OCL integrity constraints specified in UML conceptual schemas. Since our method works at a conceptual level, its results are useful in efficiently evaluating constraints regardless of the technology platform in which the conceptual schema is to be implemented.}

ABSTRACT = {In MDE diverse modeling and model transformation languages are applied to describe and derive the envisioned system. Traceability is a prerequisite for main- taining consistency between different development artifacts. Thereby, the usefulness of traceability links increases with their completeness and correctness. In practice, automatic creation and maintenance of traceability links is required to be useful. This is addressed by heuristic approaches that derive traceability information statically or by model transformation technologies that provide traceability links as additional ex- ecution result. However, the maintenance of traceability links for a set of diverse languages and transformation technologies as combined in MDE is still a challenging task. In this paper, we present a framework that provides and treats all traceability information using the common format of hierarchical megamodels. Thereby, different approaches for gaining traceability information can be combined. Information pro- vided by transformation technologies is translated into this common format.}

ABSTRACT = {Through the more and more widespread application of model-driven engineering (MDE) and the increasing diversity in applied modeling paradigms within single projects, there is an increasing need to capture not only models in isolation but also their relations. This paper is a survey on techniques capturing such relations, such as megamodels or macromodels, based on existing scientic literature. Therefore, we consider various denitions of these techniques. We further examine characteristics of the dierent techniques. We will propose a unied core denition of a megamodel that captures the core properties of megamodels and which can be extended to the needs of the dierent applications of megamodels. Finally, we give an outlook on arising application areas for megamodels.}

      ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on the challenges of modeling cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that arise from the intrinsic heterogeneity, concurrency, and sensitivity to timing of such systems. It uses a portion of an aircraft vehicle management system (VMS), specifically the fuel management subsystem, to illustrate the challenges, and then discusses technologies that at least partially address the challenges. Specific technologies described include hybrid system modeling and simulation, concurrent and heterogeneous models of computation, the use of domain-specific ontologies to enhance modularity, and the joint modeling of functionality and implementation architectures.},

abstract = "Recent work in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is exploring the use of formal ontologies as a way of specifying content-specific agreements for the sharing and reuse of knowledge among software entities. We take an engineering perspective on the development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices are evaluated against the design criteria."
