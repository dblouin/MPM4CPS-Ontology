%\textit{ \textbf{TODO Holger}: Explanation of use of framework related to the ontology structure diagram}

This document reports on the Framework to Relate / Combine Modeling Languages
and Techniques of Working Group1 on Foundations of the ICT COST Action IC1404
Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems (MPM4CPS)\uidx{System}. It first presents
an ontology of Cyber-Physical Systems in chapter \ref{ch:cps} and then an
ontology of Multi-Paradigm Modeling in chapter \ref{ch:mpm}. Then, these
ontologies are combined to define an ontology of Multi-Paradigm Modeling for
Cyber-Physical Systems presented in chapter \ref{ch:mpm4cps}. Finally, a number
of megamodel examples are presented in chapter \ref{ch:catalog} that instantiate
the core ontologies and make use of the catalog of languages\didx{ModelingLanguage} and tools\didx{Tool}
individuals.

The work of working group 1 on foundations revealed that the dependencies
between the framework targeted in this report and the state-of-the-art report in
form of deliverable D1.1 \cite{MPM4CPS-D1-1v1} was much more tight than
initially expected. To avoid capturing some content of the state-of-the-art
report also in a redundant form in the ontologies of the framework of this
report, it was decided instead to include the relevant information in the
ontologies and extract it from there automatically for generating the
state-of-the-art report.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{Overview of the structure of the MPM4CPS ontology}
\label{fig:ontology_structure}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:ontology_structure}, the structure of the framework and its
elements in form of the different ontologies and its instances is  presented.

The first column depicts the framework and its ontologies as presented in this report. This includes 
the ontology of Cyber-Physical Systems presented in chapter \ref{ch:cps}, the
ontology of Multi-Paradigm Modeling presented in chapter \ref{ch:mpm} and the
combined ontology of Multi-Paradigm Modeling for Cyber-Physical Systems
presented in chapter \ref{ch:mpm4cps}.

The Glossary of Terms for Cyber-Physical Systems presented in the report on the
State-of-the-art on Current Formalisms used in Cyber-Physical Systems
Development covered by deliverable D1.1 \cite{MPM4CPS-D1-1v1} is extracted
automatically from these ontologies and the  contained concepts defining the
framework.

In the second column, the catalog of modeling languages\uidx{ModelingLanguage} and tools\uidx{Tool} that
is an instance of the MPM4CPS ontology presented  in the report on the
State-of-the-art on Current Formalisms used in Cyber-Physical Systems
Development covered by deliverable D1.1 \cite{MPM4CPS-D1-1v1} is depicted. The
catalog of that deliverable will be automatically derived from this instance
such that ontology and instances can be kept consistent with only minimal
coordination efforts.%https://www.sharelatex.com/project/5ae2fed74797f945fcb70b13

In the third column, some examples for CPS employing MPM in form of
mega models are depicted that are presented in detail in the Catalog of
Megamodel Examples in chapter \ref{ch:catalog}. As shown in the figure, these
examples employ the languages and tools listed in the report on the
State-of-the-art on Current Formalisms used in Cyber-Physical Systems
Development and covered by deliverable D1.1 \cite{MPM4CPS-D1-1v1}, and also 
instantiate the MPM4CPS ontology.

\section{Ontology Development Approach}


To define the ontologies of WG1, we have carried out a domain analysis process\uidx{Process}
\cite{Kang1990}. The domain analysis process can be defined as the process of
identifying, capturing\uidx{CapturingOperation} and organizing domain knowledge about the problem domain with the purpose of making it reusable when creating new systems. A domain is usually defined as an area of knowledge or activity characterized by a set of concepts and terminology understood by practitioners in that area. In our context, the domains of consideration are the domains of CPS and MPM, and we aim to
derive and model the concepts of these domains. Figure \ref{fig:domain_analysis_methods}
represents the common structure of domain analysis methods as it has been derived from survey studies on domain analysis methods.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/domain_analysis_methods.png}
\caption{Common structure of domain analysis methods (adopted from:
\cite{Tekinerdogan2013})}
\label{fig:domain_analysis_methods}
\end{figure}

Conventional domain analysis methods consist generally of the activities Domain
Scoping  and Domain Modeling: Domain Scoping identifies the domains of
interest, the stakeholders\uidx{Stakeholder}, and their goals, and defines the scope of the
domain. Domain Modeling is the activity for representing the domain, or the
domain model. In our study the outputs of the domain modeling process\uidx{Process} will be the set of ontologies for CPS and MPM as identified by figure \ref{fig:ontology_structure}.

The domain model can be represented in different forms such as ontological
languages, object-oriented language, algebraic specifications, rules, conceptual
models etc. Typically, a domain model is formed through a commonality and
variability analysis to concepts in the domain. A domain model is used as a
basis for engineering components intended for use in multiple applications
within the domain.

One of the popular approaches for domain modeling is feature modeling. A feature
is a system property that is relevant to some stakeholder\uidx{Stakeholder} and is used to capture
commonalities or discriminate between. A feature model is a model that defines
features and their dependencies. Feature models are usually represented in
feature diagrams (or tables). A feature diagram is a tree with the root
representing a concept (e.g., a software system), and its descendent nodes are
features. Relationships between a parent feature and its child features (or
sub-features) are categorized as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mandatory - child feature is required.
	\item Optional - child feature is optional.
	\item Or -at least one of the sub-features must be selected.
	\item Alternative (xor) - one of the sub-features must be selected
\end{itemize}

A feature configuration is a set of features which describes a member of an SPL.
A feature constraint further restricts the possible selections of features to
define configurations.  The most common feature constraints\uidx{Constraint} are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A requires B - The selection of A in a product implies the selection of B.
	\item A excludes B - A and B cannot be part of the same product.
\end{itemize}

Feature modeling is a domain modeling technique, which is widely used to model
the commonality and variability of a particular domain or product family.
Another domain modeling technique that is used in software engineering is
ontology modeling. A commonly accepted definition of an ontology is
``an explicit specification of conceptualization'' \cite{Gruber1995}. An
ontology represents the semantics of concepts and their relationships using some description language. Basic feature modeling is also a concept description technique that focuses on modeling both the commonality and variability. It has been indicated that feature models can be seen as views on ontologies \cite{Czarnecki2006}.

To develop the WG1 ontologies presented in details in the following chapters, the aforementioned techniques have been used. For the CPS ontology, feature modeling has been used while for the MPM ontology, modeling with the W3C OWL language and its tool Protege has been used. Consequently, using the concepts developed in \cite{Czarnecki2006}, we present a version of the CPS ontology using the W3C OWL language that has been derived directly from the feature model. This enables uniform study and analysis of all the ontologies, with same semantics, presented in this deliverable. 
%In the next year, it is planned to also integrate the CPS ontology into the Protege OWL technical space.

%
As outlined in the introduction of Chapter~\ref{ch:introduction} in Figure~\ref{fig:ontology_structure}, the structure of the framework and its elements are organized in the form of different ontologies providing classes for the covered domains and individuals (instances) for these classes. The ontology presented in this chapter serves in this context as foundation to define an ontology of Cyber-Physical Systems later in Chapter~\ref{ch:cps} and an ontology of Multi-Paradigm Modeling in Chapter~\ref{ch:mpm}. Then, these ontologies together with the one of this chapter are combined to define an ontology of Multi-Paradigm Modeling for Cyber-Physical Systems presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:mpm4cps}.

\label{ch:cps}

\section{State-of-the-art}

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems\uidx{System} that tightly integrate computation 
with networking and physical processes. Such systems form large networks that 
communicate with each other and rely on actuators and sensors to monitor and 
control complex with physical processes, creating complex feedback loops 
between the physical and the cyber worlds. CPS bring innovation in terms of 
economic and societal impacts for various kinds of industries, creating 
entirely new markets and platforms for growth. CPS have growing applications in 
various domains, including healthcare, transportation, precision agriculture, energy
conservation, environmental control, avionics, critical infrastructure control
(electric and nuclear power plants, water resources, and communications systems), 
high confidence medical devices and systems, traffic control and safety\uidx{Safety}, 
advanced automotive systems, process control, distributed robotics (telepresence, 
telemedicine), manufacturing, and smart city engineering. The positive economic 
impact of any one of these applications areas is enormous.

Technically, CPS systems are inherently heterogeneous\uidx{Heterogeneity}, typically comprising 
mechanical, hydraulic, material, electrical, electronic, and computational components. 
The engineering process\uidx{Process} of CPS requires distinct disciplines to be employed, 
resulting in a collection of models that are expressed using correspondingly 
distinct modelling formalisms\uidx{Formalism}. 

An important realization is that distinct models need to be weaved together consistently to form a complete representation of a system that enables, among other global aspects, performance analysis, exhaustive simulation and verification, hardware in the loop simulation, determining best overall parameters of the system, prototyping, or implementation. 
A new framework is required that is able to represent these connections between models and, moreover, enable reasoning about them. No single formalism is able to model all aspects of a system; modelling of a CPS system is inherently multi-paradigm\uidx{Paradigm}, which calls for a trans-disciplinary approach to be able to conjoin abstractions and models from different worlds. Physically, CPS systems are inherently heterogeneous\uidx{Heterogeneity}, typically comprising 
mechanical, hydraulic, material, electrical, electronic, among others. Those areas correspond to engineering disciplines with their own models and abstractions designed to best capture the dynamics of physical processes (e.g., differential equations, stochastic processes, etc.). Computationally, CPS systems leverage the half-century old knowledge in computer science and software engineering to essentially capture how data is transformed into other useful data, abstracting away from core physical properties occurring in the real world, and particularly the passage of time in physical processes. 

The key challenge, as identified a decade ago, is then to provide mathematical and technical foundations to conjoin physical abstractions that describe the dynamics of nature in various engineering domains, as described earlier, with models focusing solely on data transformation\uidx{TransformationOperation}. This is necessary to adequately capture and bridge both aspects of a complex, realistic cyber-physical system, and become able to reason and explore system designs collaboratively, allocating responsibilities to software and physical elements, and analyzing trade-offs between them. 

Currently, there is a few common design and modelling approaches that allow engineers to handle both aspects of CPS, allowing to bridge the involved disciplines into a shared, common one. Among the existing ones, \emph{co-simulation} showed that it is possible for computation and physics engineers to cooperate efficiently without enforcing new tools or design methods. 



\section{Ontology Overview}\label{sec:Ontology-CPS}

After a domain analysis to CPS we have derived the feature model, the top-level classification for which is shown in
figure \ref{fig:feature_model_cps_top}. The different components\uidx{Component} of a CPS system can be designed together or
separately: in the latter case, the various different components need to be integrated. A CPS has different component types which can be computational or physical. Furthermore, a CPS has a network which can have different configurations and protocols.
The various components that constitute the CPS fall under the ConstituentElement class. The subset of the feature model corresponding to the ConstituentElement class is depicted in figure \ref{fig:feature_model_cps_constituent}.

%\iidxp{Interoperability} relates to how well the different components\uidx{Component} can operate
%together. Here we can have syntactic or semantic interoperability. Since both
%are required in CPS, these two features are considered mandatory, rather than
%alternative. Different components in a CPS can be of the same type or of different types, thereby distinguishing between homogeneous or heterogeneous CPS. The
%final feature in the feature model presents the various application domains\uidx{ApplicationDomain} in
%which CPS can be applied including manufacturing, healthcare, transportation
%etc.

\subsection{Ontology Diagram}

In this section we describe the metamodel for
CPS which represents the concepts and their relations\uidx{Relation}. The metamodel is shown in figure \ref{fig:cps_classes}. A
CPS system consists of CPS Components\uidx{Component} that interact by using one or more Communication Protocols running on a Communication Network\uidx{Communication}. CPS Components interact with other components. A CPS Component is a Cyber Component or Physical Component. A Cyber component is a Software Component that can have various kinds of user interfaces. The Physical Component can be a Mechanical Component or Hardware Component that can include zero or more Sensors and Actuators. Sensors monitor the Physical Component while Actuators can drive them. Essentially, sensors take a
mechanical, optical, magnetic or thermal signal and convert it into voltage
and current. This provided data can then be processed and used to define the
required action\uidx{Action}. Both cyber components and physical components could
have a virtual surrogate. Virtual entities can have different representations
such as 3D models, avatars, objects or even a social network account. Some
Virtual Entities can also interact with other Virtual Entities to fulfill their
goal.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/cps_classes.png}
\caption{Basic concepts of CPS}
\label{fig:cps_classes}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Architecture}
The architecture\iidx{Architecture} of a CPS represents the gross level structure\uidx{Structural} of the system
consisting of cyber-physical components\uidx{Component}. Current architecture design approaches for CPS seem to be primarily  domain-specific and no standard reference architecture has been yet agreed upon. 
In this line, the development of an ontology for CPS also contributes to the efforts for designing a reference architecture. 

A CPS reference architecture defines the generic structure\uidx{Structural} of CPS architectures\uidx{Architecture} for particular application domains\uidx{ApplicationDomain}, laying the foundation for functionality, dependability\uidx{Dependability}, and other quality properties. An architecture organizes the functionality and the properties\uidx{Property} of a system to enable partitioning\uidx{SystemPart}, verification, and management. 

Figure \ref{fig:layered_cps_architecture} presents a
layered view\uidx{View} of a CPS architecture inspired on the IoT stack that arranges a CPS into successive layers of cohesive modules that share similar concerns\uidx{Concern}. The four layers at the center include device layer, network layer, CPS layer, application layer, and business layer. The CPS component\uidx{Component} layer includes the capabilities for the CPS components to undertake sensing and actuation. The network layer provides functionality for networking connectivity and transport capabilities enabling the coordination of components. The Services layer consists of functionality for generic support services (such as
data processing or data storage), and specific support capabilities for the particular applications that may already apply a degree of intelligence. The application layer orchestrates the services to provide emergent properties. Then, there are two main cross-cutting concerns\uidx{Concern}. A Security layer captures the security\uidx{Security} functionality, while the management layer supports capabilities such as device management, traffic and congestion management.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/layered_cps_architecture.png}
\caption{Layered view for CPS architectures\uidx{Architecture}}
\label{fig:layered_cps_architecture}
\end{figure}

The reference architecture can be used to derive concrete application
architectures. A concrete architecture defines the boundaries and constraints
for the implementation and is used to analyze risks, balance trade-offs, plan
the implementation project and allocate tasks.

\chapter{Summary and Future Work}
%
In this report on the Framework to Relate / Combine Modeling Languages
and Techniques of Working Group1 on Foundations of the ICT COST Action IC1404
Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems (MPM4CPS), we 
%
first presented an ontology of Cyber Physical Systems in Chapter~\ref{ch:cps} and 
%
then an ontology of Multi-Paradigm Modeling in Chapter~\ref{ch:mpm}. 
%
Then, we presented an MPM4CPS ontology that combine these ontologies to cover
Multi-Paradigm Modeling for Cyber Physical Systems presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:mpm4cps}. 
%
Finally, we presented two examples for CPS development cases and sketched how they fit into 
our framework and how their megamodels resp. megamodel fragments\uidx{MegamodelFragment} covering development scenarios look like in Chapter~\ref{ch:catalog}. These examples instantiate the MPM4CPS ontology and also make use of the catalog of languages\uidx{ModelingLanguage} and tools.

%\DONE{ HG: this paragraph has to be revised when after the 28.12 it is clear what the different parts will finally contain and whether there will be any restructurings. }

We
%
developed a CPS ontology such that the catalog of languages can be well classified,
developed a MPM ontology such that all needs of the example cases for CPS development approaches are covered, and
developed a first MPM4CPS ontology that integrate both based on viewpoints. 
%
Furthermore, we developed documentation generators that produce detailed specifications from the ontologies.

%\DONE{ HG: please add keywords for suggested future work or comments about the already suggested directions. HG: none received ... }

As future work, we plan 
%
to further enrich the CPS ontology, the MPM ontology, and the MPM4CPS ontology as ongoing community effort. 
%
