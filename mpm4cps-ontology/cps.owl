A highly accurate system should converge to the actual outcome as close as possible. High accuracy especially comes into play for CPS applications where even small imprecisions are likely to cause system failures. For example, a motion-based object tracking system under the presence of imperfect sensor conditions may take untimely control action based on incorrect object position estimation, which in return leads to the system failure.</Literal>

A highly adaptable system should be quickly adaptable to evolving needs/circumstances. Adaptability is one of the key features in the next generation air transportation systems (e.g. NextGen). NextGen&apos;s capabilities enhance airspace performance with its computerized air transportation network which enables air vehicles immediately to accommodate themselves to evolving operational environment such as weather conditions, air vehicle routing and other pertinent flight trajectory patterns over satellites, air traffic congestion, and issues related to security.</Literal>

For example, in Cyber-Physical Medical Systems, medical data shed light on necessary actions to be taken in a timely manner to save a patient&apos;s life.

        <Literal datatypeIRI="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral">Composibility refers to the property of several components to be merged within a system and their inter-relationships. A highly composable system should allow recombination of the system components repeatedly to satisfy specific system requirements. Composibility should be examined in different levels (e.g. device composibility, code composibility, service composibility, system composibility). Certainly, system composibility is more challenging, hence the need for well-defined composition methodologies that follow composition properties from the bottom up. Additionally, requirements and evaluations must be composable accordingly. In the future, it will probably be of paramount importance to incrementally add emerging systems to the system of systems (e.g. CPS) with some predictable confidence without degrading the operation of the resulting  system.</Literal>

        <Literal datatypeIRI="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral">Compositionality refers to the property of how well a system can be understood entirely by examining every part of it. A highly compositional system should provide great insight about the whole from derived behaviors of its constituent parts/components. Achieving high compositionality in CPS design is very challenging especially due to the chaotic behavior of constituent physical subsystems. Designing highly compositional CPS involves strong reasoning about the behavior of all constituent cyber and physical subsystems/components and devising cyber-physical methodologies for assembling CPSs from individual cyber and physical components, while requiring precise property taxonomies, formal metrics and standard test benches for their evaluation, and well-defined mathematical models of the overall system and its constituents.</Literal>

        <Literal datatypeIRI="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral">Confidentiality refers to the property of allowing only the authorized parties to access sensitive information generated within the system. A highly confidential system should employ the most secure methods of protection from unauthorized access, disclosure, or tampering. Data confidentiality is an important issue that needs to be satisfied in most CPS applications. For example, in an emergency management sensor network, attacks targeting confidentiality of data transmitted may degrade effectiveness of an emergency management system. Confidentiality of data transmitted through attacked sensor nodes can be compromised and that can cause data flow in the network to be directed over compromised sensors; critical data to be eavesdropped; or fake node identities to be generated in the network. Further, false/malicious data can be injected into the network over those fake nodes. Therefore, confidentiality of data circulation needs to be retained in a reasonable degree.</Literal>

        <Literal datatypeIRI="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral">Dependability refers to the property of a system to perform required functionalities during its operation without significant degradation in its performance and outcome. Dependability reflects the degree of trust put in the whole system. A highly dependable system should operate properly without intrusion, deliver requested services as specified and not fail during its operation. The words dependability and trustworthiness are often used interchangeably. Assuring dependability before actual system operation is a very difficult task to achieve. For example, timing uncertainties regarding sensor readings and prompt actuation may degrade dependability and lead to unanticipated consequences. Cyber and physical components of the system are inherently interdependent and those underlying components might be dynamically interconnected during system operation, which, in return, renders dependability analysis very difficult. A common language to express dependability related information across constituent systems/underlying components should be introduced in the design stage.</Literal>

CPSs are inherently heterogeneous due to constituent physical dynamics, computational elements, control logic, and deployment of diverse communication technologies. Therefore, CPSs necessitate heterogeneous composition of all system components. For example, incorporating heterogeneous computing and communication capabilities, future medical devices are likely to be interconnected in increasingly complex open systems with a plug-and-play fashion, which makes a heterogeneous control network and closed loop control of interconnected devices crucial. Configuration of such devices may be highly dynamic depending on patient-specific medical considerations. Enabled by the science and emerging technologies, medical systems of the future are expected to provide situation-aware component autonomy, cooperative coordination, real-time guarantee, and heterogeneous personalized configurations far more capable and complex than today&apos;s.</Literal>

CPSs need to be developed with greater assurance by providing integrity check mechanisms on several occasions (such as data integrity of network packets, distinguishing malicious behaviors from the ambient noise, identifying false data injection and compromised sensor/actuator components etc.). Properties of the physical and cyber processes should be well-understood and thus can be utilized to define required integrity assurance.</Literal>

The lack of interoperability standards often causes reduction in the effectiveness of complicated and critical missions.

Many medical devices perform operations in real-time, satisfying different timing constraints and showing diverse sensitivity to timing uncertainties (e.g. delays, jitters etc.). However, not all components of CPMS are time-predictable. Therefore, in addition to new programming and networking abstractions, new policies of resource allocation and scheduling should be developed to ensure predictable end-to-end timing constraints.</Literal>

The certification of system capabilities about how to do things correctly does not mean that they are done correctly. So a highly reliable system makes sure that it does the things right. Considering the fact that CPSs are expected to operate reliably in open, evolving, and uncertain environments, uncertainty in the knowledge, attribute (e.g. timing), or outcome of a process in the CPS infrastructure makes it necessary to quantify uncertainties during the CPS design stage. That uncertainty analysis will yield to effective CPS reliability characterization. Besides, accuracy of physical and cyber components, potential errors in design/control flow, cross-domain network connections in an ad-hoc manner limit the CPS reliability.</Literal>

in an acceptable quality in case the system is exposed to any inner or outer difficulties (e.g. sudden defect, malfunctioning components, rising workload etc.) that do not exceed its endurance limit. A highly resilient system should be self-healing and comprise early detection and fast recovery mechanisms against failures to continue to meet the demands for services. High resilience comes into play in delivering mission-critical services (e.g. automated brake control in vehicular CPS, air and oxygen flow control over an automated medical ventilator etc.). Mission-critical CPS applications are often required to operate even in case of disruptions at any level of the system (e.g. hardware, software, network connections, or the underlying infrastructure). Therefore, designing highly resilient CPS requires thorough understanding of potential failures and disruptions, the resilience properties of the pertinent application, and system evolution due to the dynamically changing nature of the operational environment.</Literal>

The increase in the system throughput should be proportional to the increase in the system resources. A highly scalable system should provide scatter and gather mechanisms for workload balancing and effective communication protocols to improve the performance. Depending on their scale, CPSs may comprise over thousands of embedded computers, sensors, and actuators that must work together effectively. Scalable embedded many-core architectures with a programmable interconnect network can be deployed to deliver increasing compute demand in CPS. Further, a high performance and highly scalable infrastructure is needed to allow the entities of CPS to join and leave the existing network dynamically. In the presence of frequent data dissemination among those entities, dynamic software updates (i.e. changing the computer program in run-time) can help update CPS applications dynamically and use CPS resources more productively.</Literal>

        <Literal datatypeIRI="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral">Sustainability means being capable of enduring without compromising requirements of the system, while renewing the system&apos;s resources and using them efficiently. A highly sustainable system is a long lasting system which has self-healing and dynamic tuning capabilities under evolving circumstances. Sustainability from energy perspective is an important part of energy provision and management policies. For example, the Smart Grid facilitates energy distribution, management, and customization from the perspective of customers or service providers by incorporating green sources of energy extracted from the physical environment. However, intermittent energy supply and unknown/ill-defined load characterization hinders the efforts to maintain long-term operation of the Smart Grid. To maintain sustainability, the Smart Grid requires planning and operation under uncertainties, use of real-time performance measurements, dynamic optimization techniques for energy usage, environment-aware duty cycling of computing units, and devising self-contained energy distribution facilities (such as autonomous micro grids).</Literal>
